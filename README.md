# Grocery_Sales_Data_Analysis_Project

## üìå Project Overview

The **Grocery Sales Analysis** project is a data-driven exploration of a simulated retail environment using a structured relational database. It provides a four-month snapshot of sales transactions, customer demographics, product inventory, employee performance, and geographic distribution across multiple cities and countries.
