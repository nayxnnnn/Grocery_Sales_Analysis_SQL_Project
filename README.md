# Grocery_Sales_Data_Analysis_Project

## üìå Project Overview

The **Grocery Sales Analysis** project is a data-driven exploration of a simulated retail environment using a structured relational database. It provides a four-month snapshot of sales transactions, customer demographics, product inventory, employee performance, and geographic distribution across multiple cities and countries.
This project is designed to help data analysts and aspiring data scientists practice real-world SQL querying, data cleaning, and insight extraction. The dataset is fully normalized and includes over 1,00,000 records, offering a rich and realistic foundation for business intelligence reporting and exploratory data analysis.
